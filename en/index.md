### Developing Embedded Software

<p>WARDuino offers a novel way of developing software on microcontrollers. The WARDuino virtual machine forms the core of this approach, but many different projects have formed around the virtual machine. From a variety of novel debuggers, to a unique testing framework.</p>

### Research Prototypes

The projects under the WARDuino umbrella are developed by researchers at the [TOPL lab](https://users.ugent.be/~chscholl/) (Ghent University) and the [DisCo group](https://soft.vub.ac.be/disco/) (Vrije Universiteit Brussel). The software are developed in the first place as research prototypes. Expect possible bugs or performance issues.
