# Getting Started

In this guide, you will find instructions on how to start programming software for microcontrollers in AssemblyScript and Rust by using WARDuino.

## Installation

To get started you need to install the WARDuino SDK for your favorite language. You can use the following command:

<code-group>
<code-block title="AS">
```bash
npm install as-warduino
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="Rust">
```bash
cargo install warduino
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

The command install the language library that provides you access to the [primitives](/en/warduino/modules/) of the WARDuino from AssemblyScript or Rust. It also installs the VM and all necessary tools to compile and upload your program to your microcontroller.
