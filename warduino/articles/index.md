## EDWARD (2022)

EDWARD is the novel <i>out-of-place</i> debugger for WARDuino, developed to simplify debugging concurrent programs. The EDWARD debugger allows developers to debug programs largely on their own laptop—thereby enabling more advanced debugging techniques—while using a remote microcontroller as a zombie that can still provide realtime peripheral data. Asynchronous events on the remote zombie are captured by the local debugger, and a new set of debugging instructions give developers control over the timings of the events.

More information can be found in the [EDWARD reference](/reference/edward/).

## WARDuino (2019)

WARDuino was the first WebAssembly virtual machine to target microcontrollers, such as the ESP32s, and included a remote debugger and support for partial over-the-air reprogramming of the devices.
