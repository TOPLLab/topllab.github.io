# WARDuino

The WARDuino virtual machine is a WebAssembly runtime for microcontrollers, which runs both under the Arduino and ESP-IDF toolchains.

Here you will find a full reference on the virtual machine and its core components.
If you are looking to just get started with programming, [the Starter's Guide](/en/guide/) explains how to use WARDuino to write software using AssemblyScript or Rust.
